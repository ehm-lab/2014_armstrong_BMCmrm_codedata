### Conditional Poisson regression for environmental epidemiology

------------------------------------------------------------------------

An illustration of conditional Poisson models for analyses of environmental risk factors in epidemiological studies. In particular, conditional Poisson represents a computationally convenient alternative to both conditional logistic case-crossover models (when data are aggregated in time series form) and to standard Poisson regression for long time series (when control for time is achieved with computationally expensive spline functions). The code follows the examples included in the following article, which illustrates the methodology and some applications:
